    <h1>Christian Eliopoulos</h1>
    <p>I am looking for a co-op/internship in game development or web development.
        (I am a second year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology.)</p>
    <h2>Here are some of my projects:</h2>

            <h3>Warping Game</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/warpCollageFinal.png">
            <p>This personal project is a collection of various games that link to each other, and have a rather strange continuous narrative. 
                It is inspired by my dream journal- specifically the way I think and what I feel while in long-lasting dreams.
                The games use Unity/C#, PuzzleScript, Flickgame, Lua/PICO-8, and Godot.
                I've been working on it for a while, and have recently uploaded the final game.
                I submitted it to two college game showcases (at RIT and RPI), and it was a finalist at both of them.
                <br>You can play the first PuzzleScript game <a href="https://blazerboy.itch.io/warping-game" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                <br>You can find links to all of the games <a href="https://blazerboy.itch.io/warping-game" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p>

            <h3>New Adventure</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/adventurePicture.PNG">
                <p>This is inspired by the Atari game <i>Adventure</i>. I made it in PixiJS for a web development class.
                I figured out how to make different rooms using PIXI.Containers and swapping between them by making them 
                visible or invisible, and storing map data to them with arrays. Collision with items doesn't work well though.
                I've been very focused on Warping Game recently.
               <br>You can play it <a href="https://people.rit.edu/cge7497/235/project3/project.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Asteroids</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/asteroidsPicture.PNG">
            <p>This is a recreation of the Atari game <i>Asteroids</i>. I made the spritework using Aseprite, and got better at programming force vectors and debugging in Unity.
                <br> Here's a link to download it: <a href="Christian_Eliopoulos-Asteroids.zip" download>Asteroid Windows Download Link (20 MB)</a>
                 <br>I'd link an HTML version, but the editable project file is at my university, and campus is currently closed. </p>
