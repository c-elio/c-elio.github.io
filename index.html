    <h1>Christian Eliopoulos</h1>
    <p>I am looking for a full-time job in software or web development. <a href="ChristianEliopoulos_Resume.pdf"
            target="_blank">Here's my resume.</a>
        <br>(I'm a fourth year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology.)
    </p>
    <h2>Here are some of my projects:</h2>

            <h3>Warping Game</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/warpCollageFinal.png">
            <p>This personal project is a collection of various games that link to each other.
                It is inspired by my dream journal- specifically the way I think and what I feel while in long-lasting
                dreams.
                The games use Unity/C#, PuzzleScript, Flickgame, Lua/PICO-8, and Godot.
                <br><br>Here is a link to the first game: <a href="https://blazerboy.itch.io/warping-game"
                    target="_blank">First Game (PuzzleScript).</a>
                <br>You can find links to all of the games <a

            <h3>Poke-API Mapillary Mashup</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/pokeMap.PNG">
            <p>Inspired by Pokemon Go, this uses street images from Mapillary, Pokemon data from PokeAPI, and Mapbox to
                simulate
                seeing Pokemon on the street.
                <br>Main tasks involved reading documentation, structuring the program to fetch data in the correct
                order, and migrating.
            </p>
                Here's a link to play it: <a

            <h3>New Adventure</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/adventurePicture.PNG">
            <p>This is inspired by the Atari game <i>Adventure</i>. I made it in PixiJS for a web development class.
                I figured out how to make different rooms using PIXI.Containers and swapping between them by making them
                visible or invisible, and storing map data to them with arrays.
                <br><br>You can play it <a href="https://people.rit.edu/cge7497/235/project3/project.html"

            <h3>Asteroids</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/asteroidsPicture.PNG">
            <p>This is a recreation of the Atari game <i>Asteroids</i>. I made the spritework using Aseprite, and got
                better at programming force vectors and debugging in Unity.
