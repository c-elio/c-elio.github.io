            <h3>Warp Dream</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/warpCollageFinal.png">
            <p>This personal project is a collection of various games that link to each other. 
                It is inspired by my dream journal- specifically the way I think and what I feel while in long-lasting dreams.
                The games use Unity/C#, PuzzleScript, Flickgame, Lua/PICO-8, and GoDot.
                I've been working on it for a while, and have recently uploaded the final game.
                I submitted the game to two game s

                https://blazerboy.itch.io/e?secret=43M92zK945SPsI4w7tOmpbAWq8 I plan on smoothing out the collision on this one, and perhaps adding some sound effects for when you click.

            <h3>Asteroids</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/asteroidsPicture.PNG">
            <p>This is a recreation of the Atari game <i>Asteroids</i>. I made the spritework using Aseprite, and got better at programming force vectors and debugging in Unity.
                <br> Here's a link to download it: <a href="Christian_Eliopoulos-Asteroids.zip" download>Asteroid Windows Download Link (20 MB)</a>
                 <br>I'd link an HTML version, but the editable project file is at my university, and campus is currently closed. </p>

            <h3>New Adventure</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/adventurePicture.PNG">
            <p>This is inspired by the Atari game <i>Adventure</i>. I made it in PixiJS for a web development class.
                I figured out how to make different rooms using PIXI.Containers, swapping between them by making them 
                visible or invisible, and storing map data to them with arrays.  Collision with items doesn't work well though.
                I've been very focused on Warp Dream recently.
