    <h1>Christian Eliopoulos</h1>
    <p>I am looking for a co-op/internship in game development or web development.
        (I am a second year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology.)</p>
    <h2>Here are some of my projects:</h2>
    <div id="projectsList">
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Warp Dream</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/warpCollageFinal.png">
            <p>This personal project is a collection of various games that link to each other.
                The games use Unity/C#, PuzzleScript, Lua/PICO-8, and GoDot.
                I've been designing it for a while, and the nature of the game means it can go on for a while.
                It's almost done though- the final game will be added in the next week.
                <br>You can play the first game <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=fe0b3a9c915b493c2dfcc92f7dc8c912" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Asteroids</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/asteroidsPicture.PNG">
            <p>This is a recreation of the Atari game <i>Asteroids</i>. I made the spritework using Aseprite, and got better at programming force vectors and debugging in Unity.
                <br> Here's a link to download it: <a href="Christian_Eliopoulos-Asteroids.zip" download>Asteroid Windows Download Link (20 MB)</a>
                 <br>I'd link an HTML version, but the editable project file is at my university, and campus is currently closed. </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>New Adventure</h3>
            <img class="gameImage" src="images/adventurePicture.PNG">
            <p>This is inspired by the Atari game <i>Adventure</i>. I made it in PixiJS for a web development class.
                I figured out how to make different rooms using PIXI.Containers, swapping between them by making them 
                visible or invisible, and storing map data to them with arrays.  Collision with items doesn't work well though.
                I've been very focused on Warp Dream recently.
